# Week 3 Wed GPIO

---------------
#### :dizzy: **Lab Date :** Jan 28 Wednesday
#### :alarm_clock: **Due Date :** 2:00 pm Feb 2 (next Monday)   
#### :pencil: Every group member must be present for every check point.
-------------------

## 1. GPIO Pins

In the CLI terminal, type `pinout` to display the GPIO pinout of your Raspberry Pi.

> **Note:** On the physical board, you will see the silkscreen label **`J8`** next to the GPIO header. This label indicates the orientation of the pinout columns shown in the `pinout` output.

Or you can just Google Search "raspberry pi 5 pinout"`.

## 1. GPIO Zero Library

In the Raspberry Pi OS, you can use ``GPIO Zero`` library in Python to control the GPIO pins.

Simple examples with code are provided in the official repo of Raspberry Pi:

https://github.com/raspberrypi/documentation/blob/master/documentation/asciidoc/computers/os/using-gpio.adoc

🎉 **Check Point 1**
<br>Show lab staff your output in Python IDE.
<br>During check, you will be asked to modify the code to get other outputs among the command-line utilities in Section 1.

🎉 **Check Point 2**
<br>Each student will show the basic operations to the lab staff.
