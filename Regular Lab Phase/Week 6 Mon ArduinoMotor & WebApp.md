## 1. Arduino Motor


## 3. Arduino Servo Motor Basic 
- [ ] **Motor set-up**

  The servo motor we use is Smraza 9G Micro Servo Motor 

  The purchase link is https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07L2SF3R4?th=1 

  You can find its wiring and specs on this purchase page.

  Each group uses 2 servo motors.

  Also screw the plastic blade to it, so that you can observe the rotating angle.

- [ ] **Power Supply set-up**

> [!CAUTION]
> Never use a microcontroller's Pin (Arduino/Pi/...) to directly power motors. <br> You need to use an external Power Supply.<br>
> Also make sure Common Ground between the external Power Supply and board.

  You can use the dual-head screwdriver:

  i) one blade-shaped head to turn power supply voltage; ii) the other cross-shaped head tighten wire insertion

- [ ] **Run the Motor**

Connect Arduino to 2 motors.

Code the Arduino. Such that you can turn 2 motors at different angles.
