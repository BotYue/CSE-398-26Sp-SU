#### :pencil: Every group member must be present for every check point.
-------------------

## 1. CLI Terminal

In the Raspberry Pi OS, there are some useful CLI commands to quick check the status of your Pi.

They are listed on the official repo of Raspberry Pi:

https://github.com/raspberrypi/documentation/blob/master/documentation/asciidoc/computers/os/graphics-utilities.adoc 

- [ ] **Open your CLI terminal, try all commands listed there**
- [ ] **Log each command and its output using Markdown code blocks**

:pushpin: Note: Since this lab, every thing you conduct need to be recorded in your Markdown. Refer to [Example Markdown Guide](../Lab%20Info/example%20markdown.md) for details.

------
## 2. Python IDE

In the Raspberry Pi OS, Python is default installed in Pi OS.

Use ``Thonny`` as your default Python IDE. 

You can install other Python IDEs such as ``VS Code`` from ``Pi-Apps`` if you prefer.

- [ ] **Write simple Python code to print the temperature of the SoC, and SDRAM Core Voltage**

> **Note:** Terminal commands can be executed in Python using the [`subprocess`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html) module. Read the official document in this link to understand it.

- [ ] **Save it to any folder you prefer**

🎉 **Check Point 1**
<br>Show lab staff your output in Python IDE.
<br>During check, you will be asked to modify the code to get other outputs among the command-line utilities in Section 1.

----------
## 3. Nano Editor in Terminal

- [ ] In CLI Terminal, try to navigate and execute your previous saved Python code in Section 2.

In Raspberry Pi Terminal, it has a built-in ``nano editor``. It allows you to edit code directly in Terminal. 

You can ``Ctrl+G`` to display the help in editor.

- [ ] Practice using the ``nano editor`` in the terminal. Become familiar with basic operations, including search, cut, and paste.

- [ ] In ``nano editor``, revise to previous saved Python code, make it additionally print date and your name.

🎉 **Check Point 2**
<br>Each student will show the basic ``nano editor`` operations to the lab staff.
